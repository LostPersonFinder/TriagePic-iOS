# TriagePic - iOS #

TriagePic is designed for use by hospital staff to aid in reuniting friends and family after mass casualty disasters when they brought in for triage and potential hospitalization.  

Following a mass casualty event, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, or other man-made events, hospitals are inundated with victims and are busy caring for the wounded. Meanwhile friends and family of the victims are fervently searching for them. To help address family reunification needs for such victims, the National Library of Medicine developed TriagePic -- a reporting and tracking tool that allows hospital staff to capture photos and brief information (name, age, gender, triage zone, etc.) on disaster victims as they arrive at the hospital. The information on victims is sent to a private local hospital database for use by appropriate staff for family reunification purposes.  

The TriagePic app and TriageTrak web portal are products of the Lost Person Finder project (now defunct) at the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, which is an intramural R&D division of the U.S. National Library of Medicine,  part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
